# ðŸ”—Description:
- This Repository contains the code for an end to end data science project-Banglore House Price Prediction.
- This is a Regression based ML project where the end goal is to predict the house price based on area, number of bathrooms, number of rooms and location in Banglore city.
- In this project, I have implemented many machine learning techniques like Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Outlier Detection and Removal, Dimensionality Reduction, Hyper    parameter tuning and Model Building.
- With the help of the trained model, i have created an web application using django as backend, HTML, CSS and Javascript as frontend.
- Finally the webapp is deployed on heroku cloud. Click this [link](http://bhp-online.herokuapp.com/) to use this app.
